Version 4 (1 Feb 2010)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Fixed a serious miss I made in Version 3, which had players start with
    just one city instead of five, because I forgot to remove a setting I use
    while I test the game code. STUPID!!!


Version 3 (26 Jan 2010)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Began adding high resolution graphics! Bitmaps for the font, the mouse
    cursor and parts of the diplomacy terminal are now in high resolution.
(*) Replaced the "Nuclear War" logo to say "NetNuclear" instead.
(*) The AI now checks all opponents for any prepared missiles or bombers
    before selecting to use a defense system.
(*) Added the random welcome messages from the original game to be displayed
    upon a new game start.
(*) Computer opponents now "speak" random sentences when clicking on their
    monitors and after attacking them, like in the original game.
(*) Fixed a bug that would crash the program if a connected clients address
    couldn't be resolved properly.
(*) Fixed a bug which made bombers usable even though they had been shot down.
(*) Fixed a bug that would potentially crash the program when closing the
    server on some systems.
(*) Receiving a chat message while on the world screen no longer interrupts
    the currently playing sound effect.
(*) Mouse cursor only drawn if the window has focus.
(*) Adjusted the damage done by warheads to be more accurate.


Version 2 (7 Jan 2010)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) Fixed a typo in the message displayed on a successful propaganda strike.
    It said "Defectors leave A for B", when it should have been "B for A".
(*) Fixed a bug (or miss) where population numbers didn't update after a
    successful propaganda strike. This sometimes caused cities to display
    negative population numbers, like -8, and also sometimes made it possible
    to keep playing even after having been defeated.
(*) Increased the screen resolution to 640x480 pixels. Previous was 640x400.
(*) Minor cosmetic changes to the diplomacy terminal and world screen to match
    the slightly higher screen resolution.
(*) Population numbers now displayed in white colour (like in the original),
    instead of yellow.
(*) The hosting player now starts in the middle, so that the monitors will
    correctly match the positions of the other players countries (like in the
    original Nuclear War), when playing a single player game.
(*) Added command "/clear" to clear (reset) the telegraph.
(*) Added my e-mail and website address to be printed with the "/version"
    command.
(*) The telegraph now prints messages slightly faster.
(*) Server port can now be specified (see readme for more information).
(*) Fixed some minor typos and missing line breaks in messages.
(*) Added missing leader portraits. The previous NetNuclear version had only
    two portraits, but now has all ten from the original game.
(*) Added the names of the world leaders from the original game, to be used
    for computer opponents. A leaders name and his/her portrait is, for now,
    randomly selected when a computer player is added (with "/add").
(*) Scaled down bitmaps to half the size, not just to optimize disk space
    usage, but also because it was unnecessary to store bitmaps as twice the
    size instead of just having the program rescale them.
(*) Balanced the volume of some sound effects, which were either too high or
    too low.
(*) Changing player name with "/name" now checks if the name is available and
    not already in use by someone else.
(*) Population numbers now hidden while the "door" is opening/closing, like
    in the original game.
(*) Rewrote some parts of the readme.


Version 1 (20 Dec 2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(*) First version!
